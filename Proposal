1.) NM Helper is my potential title of my project. This is my poitenital title because I plan on making a cryptocurrency application/program and have a friend with the intials NM for which this project may be useful for.
2.) An application/program that gives you updates on prices of specific cyrptocurrencies of your choosing
3.) I will being using python via Atom to code my project. My goal is for the software to allow a user to pick a crypto of your choosing and reciueve updates for it price. I will be suing a live database of cyrptos to getting up to date prices.
4.) This project will not be for multiple classes
5.) I will be attepting this project alone
6.) A good outcome for this project would to be able to run my program and recieve live updates on the coin of your choosing
7.) A better outcome would be the ability to choose multiple coins and recieve multiple updates at once
8.) The best possible outcome would be forming this into a functioning app that sends push notifiications like you see from other stock trading apps like Robinhood, WeBull, etc.
9.) I will need to learn some terminal language since I have found that it is easiest to work through terminal while using Atom (luckily my dad has his bachelors in computer science and should be able to help me with that). Similar to the tracks posted on Canvas, I found my own track online that will help teach me a solid base on how to accomplish my goals for this project.
