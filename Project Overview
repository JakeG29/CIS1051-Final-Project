Aplogies for the length of video, the assignemt says a couple minutes so I hope 5 isnt too much. I tried to cut the time down in my second take (first take was 10 minutes)
Also apologies if I was stuttering throughout the video, recording myself makes me very nevrous


I briefly spoke about my difficulties in this project in my video but my mains ones were:
  1.) Leanring how to execute code via terminal
      - Have minior coding experience but never used a terminal like I did in this project
  2.) Coinmarketcap API
      - Learning how to even use API's and what they are
      - Coinmarketcap needing an API key
      - Coinmarketcap API having a paywall that limited my ability to test my code
  3.) Confidence
      - Very little confidence wth my abiltiy to code
      - This project for sure helped my believe a litle more in myself that I can code things if I really put my mind to it
  4.) Time
      - My lack of coding ability plus working alone slowed down my project's progression
      - I think I could have had this program meet my original goals if I had 2 more weeks to work on it
      - This project was a priority but I was struggling to balance setting time aside to work on this project and also doing the other work for my classes
      
      
Overall I had fun time trying to bring my idea to life, wish I had more to show for my effort but this is what I was able to accomplish and I'm proud of that.
