# CIS1051-Final-Project
Preposal and Github lab


A couple ideas I currently have for my project are:
    Creating an app that uses cryptocurrency data 
    Putting my own twist on a classic game (Tic-tac-toe, pong, etc)
    
Still bouncing around other ideas but these are the two that peak my interest the most

I plan on working alone for this project

No questions as of now
